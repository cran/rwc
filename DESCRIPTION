Description: Code to facilitate simulation and inference when connectivity is defined by underlying random walks. Methods for spatially-correlated pairwise distance data are especially considered. This provides core code to conduct analyses similar to that in Hanks and Hooten (2013) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.724647>.
